 Feature List - Ray Tracer
==========================

Exam No.: B283619
Project: Ray Tracer
Date: <4.12.2025>

--------------------------------------
 1. Module 1 - Scene & Camera System
--------------------------------------

[1.1] Blender Exporter (Python)（Achieved）
Export object details as a scene file in TXT format

[1.2] Camera Space （Achieved）
Camera-related capabilities have been implemented, 
and coordinate transformation at the image level has been completed.

[1.3] Image R/W（Achieved）
Support for reading and writing PPM files has been implemented.
Enables precise adjustment operations on individual pixels.

--------------------------------------
 2. Module 2 - Geometry & Acceleration
--------------------------------------

[2.1] Ray Intersection（Part Achieved）
Basic object implementation and intersection detection have been achieved, 
though various object properties remain incomplete. 
For instance, spherical deformation and full coordinate transformation for cubes are currently unavailable.

[2.2] BVH Acceleration（Achieved）
BVH node construction
AABB computation
Ray–AABB intersection
The acceleration effect is also reflected in subsequent features.
--------------------------------------
 3. Module 3 - Whitted-style Ray Tracing
--------------------------------------

[3.1] Whitted-style（Part Achieved）
Preliminary implementation of shadow effects such as reflections and refractions has been achieved, 
but further refinement is required.
The code will be merged with subsequent distributed ray tracing efforts.

[3.2] Antialiasing（Achieved）
Multiple sampling is implemented for each pixel.
Rendering time has increased significantly.

[3.3] Textures（Part Achieved）
Currently, only textures partially present in the file can be loaded.
The placement of textures within Blender remains subject to debate.


--------------------------------------
 4. Final Ray Tracer
--------------------------------------
[4.1]Sys. Integration（Part Achieved）
Preliminary integration has been achieved, supporting command-line operations.
Modularity and scalability still require improvement.

[4.2]Distributed RT（Part Achieved）
The distributed ray tracing component is partially complete, 
currently implementing soft shadow sampling and integrated lighting effects.
The number of samples can be adjusted, but this significantly impacts runtime performance.
Optimization will be considered in subsequent iterations.

[4.3]Lens effect（Part Achieved）
Basic lens effects have been implemented.
Depth-of-field blur and lens motion blur are now available.
Motion blur for objects remains unimplemented; optimization can be considered in future iterations.
